* **SQL**: MySQL  
* **Excel**: Data analysis, Pivot tables, Charts, and Dashboard design  
* **RFM Segmentation** – Customer behavior analysis.
* **Data Visualization** – Interactive charts, cards, and slicers.

##  Objectives
- Collect and clean retail transaction data  
- Perform sales trend analysis    
- Build visualizations and an interactive Excel dashboard  
- Present insights in a structured report 

##  Key Features & Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   * Processed raw transactional data.
   * Created additional fields like **Month-Year** for trend analysis.
   * Prepared RFM table for customer segmentation.

2. **RFM Analysis**
   * **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
   * **Frequency**: How often a customer made purchases.
   * **Monetary**: How much money a customer spent.
   * Segmented customers into meaningful groups (e.g., High-Value, Medium, Low-Value).

3. **Interactive Features**
   * Added **Slicers** for dynamic filtering and better user experience.
   * Ability to filter by month, year, or segment for focused analysis.

##  Dashboard Insights
   The Excel dashboard provides the following insights:
   * 📊 **Transactions by Year & Month** – trend analysis of customer purchases.
   * 👤 **Top 10 Customers** – A small group of customers contributes significantly to overall revenue.
   * 🆔 **Unique Customers** – number of distinct buyers over time.(6885)
   * 💰 **Total Revenue** – sum of all transaction amounts.(8122378)
   * 🏷️ **Revenue by Segment** – revenue contribution from RFM segments (Segment P2 generates the maximum revenue).
   * 👥 **Customers per Segment** – distribution of customers across RFM segments (P2 dominates with 64% of total customers).
   * ✅ **Customer Responses** – analysis of response variable (Only 11% of customers responded, while 89% did not engage).
   * 📅 **Average Transactions per Month** – purchasing frequency.
   * 📈 **Responses by Month** – Customer responses distributed across months with very low participation

##  Conclusion
Segment P2 dominates with 64% customers and the highest revenue share.
Customer engagement is low, with only 11% responses recorded.
The Top 10 customers contribute significantly to overall revenue.
Transactions are stable over time, averaging ~65 per month.
➡️ Focusing on P2 customers, boosting engagement, and retention strategies can drive future growth.
